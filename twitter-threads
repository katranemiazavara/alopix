            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>How COVID Spreads</h3><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDisAirborne">#COVIDisAirborne</a>. It’s transmitted when an infectious person and susceptible person are sharing air. There are 3 main scenarios:</p><p><strong>1. Close range — they share the most air. This is the highest risk.</strong></p><h3>Prof. Jose-Luis Jimenez on Twitter: &quot;4/ There are 3 general situations for airborne transmission:a) close proximity -- very dangerous, can inhale a lot of exhaled breath from someone else w/ virus-containing aerosolsb) shared room-air: people in the same room for a period of time, but not very close pic.twitter.com/FfXnw4h8er / Twitter&quot;</h3><p>4/ There are 3 general situations for airborne transmission:a) close proximity -- very dangerous, can inhale a lot of exhaled breath from someone else w/ virus-containing aerosolsb) shared room-air: people in the same room for a period of time, but not very close pic.twitter.com/FfXnw4h8er</p><p><strong>2. If they share a room, the virus particles they exhale can build up.</strong></p><p>As you inhale a higher dose (concentration, time, breathing rate), risk of infection increases. Virus can be removed through ventilation (windows) or filtration (HEPA/CR box).</p><h3>Richard Corsi, PhD, PE (Texas) on Twitter: &quot;1/ Seems like there are continuing struggles in understanding inhalation dose associated w/ virus-laden aerosol particles, a critical concept that has been lost in all of the noise. My blog from summer of 2020 - The Dose Makes the (Risk of) Infection. https://t.co/wQqC6E1gLy / Twitter&quot;</h3><p>1/ Seems like there are continuing struggles in understanding inhalation dose associated w/ virus-laden aerosol particles, a critical concept that has been lost in all of the noise. My blog from summer of 2020 - The Dose Makes the (Risk of) Infection. https://t.co/wQqC6E1gLy</p><p><strong>3. Long range transmission</strong></p><p>This is transmission with a lower dose and generally further away. It’s not as common but still a risk if you are in a house with someone who is infected.</p><h3>Before COVID Hits Your Home</h3><p>The one thing you can always do is keep the air clean. Keep the windows open as much as possible and run humidifiers, HEPA filters or CR Boxes. If someone is infected, you’ll breathe in a lower dose.</p><p>Here’s some advice:</p><h3>Dr. Theresa Tam on Twitter: &quot;As we&#39;ve been spending more time indoors, good ventilation remains important. Air purifiers and HVAC ventilation systems can help reduce the level of infectious particles in the air protecting you and your loved ones against #COVID19.

Having good RH in your home does 3 things:</p><ol><li><strong>Viruses die quicker</strong></li><li><strong>With low RH, the droplet will evaporate quickly and stay suspended in the air. With good RH, it will fall.</strong></li></ol><h3>Linsey Marr | @linseymarr@fediscience.org on Twitter: &quot;A 🧵on humidity and airborne viruses. Several articles have said that at higher relative humidity (RH), droplets/aerosols retain more water, are larger, and then fall out of the air faster. True, but the effect of RH on biological decay is probably more important. /1 / Twitter&quot;</h3><p>A 🧵on humidity and airborne viruses.

Here are some things to do:</p><ol><li><strong>Run a filter in the isolation room. If any air escapes, it will have less virus.</strong></li></ol><p><a href="https://cleanaircrew.org/someone-in-my-home-has-covid-how-do-we-isolate-safely/">https://cleanaircrew.org/someone-in-my-home-has-covid-how-do-we-isolate-safely/</a></p><p>2. <strong>Try to block any paths that the air can leak into the house at the door.</strong></p><p>3. <strong>Create negative pressure in the room</strong></p><p>Turn on an exhaust fan in an adjacent bathroom or have a fan blowing air out a window. This will cause air to leak into the room and not out.</p><p>4. <strong>Run a humidifier in the room if the air is dry.</strong> <strong>5. If a return vent is located in the isolation room, block it by taping plastic around it</strong></p><p>They look like this:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/680/0*khsjQ0YxxN_UShQ7.jpg" /></figure><h3>Your Home Furnace</h3><p>Furnace filter: If it’s a 1&quot; slot, use the Filtrete 1900. If it’s a larger slot, get a MERV-13 filter that matches the slot size. If air can’t reach the far end of the house or the furnace stops working, put back the old filter and reset the furnace.</p><p>Filtrete 1000 also works against aerosols, but 1900 is better. If you have a MERV-13/Filtrete 1000/1900 filter in your furnace, run your fan all the time to get the filtration. If your furnace filter has lower rating, leave it on auto.</p><h3>Sharing a Bathroom</h3><p>Leave the exhaust fan running between uses and keep the window open. It’s best to wait between uses, especially if you are not wearing a mask (eg. shower). 25 minutes should be fine if exhaust fan is running. The longer the better.</p><p>PSA: Close the toilet lid before flushing. Inhaling aerosolized fecal matter isn’t good for you, especially if it’s virus laden. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CloseTheLid">#CloseTheLid</a> As <a href="https://twitter.com/DFisman">@DFisman</a> says, “air: it’s the new poop”.</p><p>When you’re done, WASH YOUR HANDS!</p><p>Sharing other rooms, like a dining room is the same concept. If the infected person used it without a mask, open windows, run filters and wait before using it yourself.</p><p>Wear a N95 as much as possible, especially when not in the isolation room. If you need to take it off (eating, showering, sleeping), make sure the air is clean.</p><p>In the isolation room, it’s lower risk to unmask and more comfortable for the infected person.</p><p>If you don’t have a N95, use knot &amp; tuck with a surgical mask.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FGzTAZDsNBe0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGzTAZDsNBe0&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FGzTAZDsNBe0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/347ddc15ef36c71dd2e1ce4c1d0dce5b/href">https://medium.com/media/347ddc15ef36c71dd2e1ce4c1d0dce5b/href</a></iframe><h3>Filter Location</h3><p>If you only have 1 HEPA/CR Box or humidifier, I think it’s best in the room with the infected person as source control and for their health.</p><p>You can place one outside their room to filter air that leaks out.</p><p>Otherwise, the best room for the filter is the one that you are in. They are portable, so you can carry them around.</p><h3>Exiting</h3><p>Don’t listen to US &amp; Canadian Public Health and wait only 5 days. Best is to wait until symptoms resolve + 2 negative rapid tests on 2 days. At least wait for symptoms to resolve + negative rapid test.</p><p>N95s, filters, open windows, isolate, humidifiers — that’s it. Some can do more than others, but do what you can.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDisAirborne">#COVIDisAirborne</a>. If you know how it spreads, you know how to stop it. Exposure is inevitable, infection isn’t.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the novel coronavirus burst onto the scene, it quickly realized that the mighty HEPA filter was one of its greatest foes.</p><p>It began an aggressive anti-HEPA filter lobbying campaign with politicians, public health officials and school boards.</p><p>The goal was to spread lies about HEPA filters to ensure it could infect as many kids as possible. These gullible individuals have been doing PR for the virus and the lies need to be put to rest.</p><p><strong>Myth:</strong> HEPA filters <a href="https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1483862638291525634">blow the virus around</a></p><p><strong>Fact:</strong> They remove the virus from the air</p><p><strong>Myth:</strong> HEPA filters interfere with ventilation</p><p><strong>Fact:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1484225316943974408">No they don’t</a></p><p><strong>Myth:</strong> HEPA filters aren’t needed if minimum ventilation standards are met</p><p><strong>Fact:</strong> HEPA filters <a href="https://twitter.com/joeyfox85/status/1480351998474080261">reduce risk for airborne pathogens</a>, even if there is already ventilation.</p><p><strong>Myth:</strong> HEPA filters can only filter down to 0.3 microns</p><p><strong>Fact:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidElfstrom/status/1458396236793487362">Not true</a></p><p><strong>Myth:</strong> The virus is too small for a HEPA filter</p><p><strong>Fact:</strong> The virus is <a href="https://twitter.com/jljcolorado/status/1295954024223539200">inside aerosols</a> that can get filtered out</p><p><strong>Myth:</strong> Electrical safety issues</p><p><strong>Fact:</strong> &gt; 100,000 classrooms.

It can be easily damaged with a pencil. But the large shape is what allows it to filter so much air. The filters have a lot of surface area and the fan is 20&quot;.</p><p>Both Levoit and Austin are about 14.5&quot;. They are smaller and sturdier. The Austin is extremely durable.</p><h3>Filter Replacements</h3><ul><li><strong>Levoit LV-H133: </strong>$86 every 6–8 months</li><li><strong>Austin HM400: </strong>$370 every 5 years</li><li><strong>CR Box: </strong>$15–90 every 6 months.

It’s a great option.</p><p>Many school boards would be hesitant to put in a DIY filter. I’ve seen people hesitant to use HEPA filters and only want CR boxes. HEPA filters are just as good. Just filter the air!</p><h3>References</h3><p>There’s a range of values for CR Boxes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ventilation</strong> — Exchanging indoor air with outdoor air (slight oversimplification)</p><p><strong>Filtration</strong> — passing air through a filter</p><p><strong>Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI)</strong> — kill or inactivate microorganisms with UV light.</p><p><strong>Electronic Air Cleaning (EAC)</strong> — charge particles and discharge them into the space.</p><p>They all do different things with different types of indoor pollutants. There are many pollutants, but I’ll deal with 3 types:</p><ul><li><strong>Gasses</strong> — carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, radon</li><li><strong>Particulate Matter (PM)</strong> — dust, smoke, pollen</li><li><strong>Microbes (type of PM)</strong> — Viruses, Bacteria, Mold</li></ul><h3>Ventilation</h3><p>It removes indoor gasses, microbes and particulate matter. Mechanical ventilation includes filtration. Natural ventilation (eg. windows) doesn’t have filtration and could bring in outdoor pollution.</p><h3>Filtration</h3><p>It removes particulate matter from the air. Efficient filters (HEPA, MERV-13) can remove viruses and bacteria. Less efficient filters (MERV-8) removes dust and pollen. It does nothing for gasses.</p><h3>UVGI</h3><p>It kills microbes. It can kill viruses at a higher rate than ventilation or filtration. It does nothing for gases or particulate matter (besides microbes).</p><h3>EAC</h3><p>Poor evidence of effectiveness. It can <a href="https://medium.com/open-letter-to-address-the-use-of-electronic-air/no-to-ionizers-plasma-uvpco-bc1570b2fb9b">create harmful chemical compounds</a>. Not all electronic air cleaners discharge charged particles, although many do.</p><blockquote>Electronic air cleaning equipment includes a variety of electrically powered air-cleaning devices intended to remove particles from airstreams or to inactivate pathogens. The widely used removal mechanisms occur by electrically charging particles using corona wires, pins or needles, with plasma (positive and/or negative ions formed by charging major components of air as well as pollutant molecules), or by photocatalytic oxidation. The design of the system may create one or more reactive oxygen species (ROS), ozone, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anions, gaseous hydrogen peroxide, and others.</blockquote><h3>Summary</h3><ul><li>Avoid EAC</li><li>The rest all work against viruses.</li><li>Ventilation is the most important.</li><li>UVGI is very good for microbes but not other pollutants.</li><li>Filtration still important. Normally, with good ventilation, extra filtration not required.</li></ul><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://itsairborne.com/tweets/engineering-methods/methods/index.html"><em>https://www.itsairborne.com</em></a><em> on February 4, 2022.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=35b5069c22c3" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://itsairborne.com/ventilation-vs-filtration-vs-uvgi-vs-electronic-air-cleaning-35b5069c22c3">Ventilation vs. Filtration vs. UVGI vs. Electronic Air Cleaning</a> was originally published in <a href="https://itsairborne.com">It’s Airborne</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My wife felt sick early last week and then tested positive (RAT). Everyone in our family is now negative. My kids and I never got it. We didn’t resort to extreme measures like isolation or kids wearing N95s all day. This is how we did it:</p><p>We followed public health advice:</p><ul><li>wore comfortable cloth masks</li><li>washed our hands frequently</li><li>cleaned and disinfected — especially the toys</li><li>practiced safe physical distancing</li><li>put up plexiglass barriers as an extra precaution.</li></ul><p>Just kidding. <em>That’s not how it’s done.</em></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDisAirborne"><strong>#COVIDisAirborne</strong></a> Focus on keeping the air clean and you can stop the spread. These are the measures we took:</p><p><strong>Vaccines</strong> — we’re all fully vaccinated (including boosters) except my 3 yo. My 4 month old had 2 doses in utero. My 6 yo has 2 doses.</p><p><strong>Masks</strong> — I wore the CAN95 or CAN99 with ear loops. My wife wore a KN95 when she could, otherwise she wore a surgical mask + knot &amp; tuck. It fits her well.</p><p><strong>Filtration</strong> — We have 1 large <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/corsirosenthalbox">#corsirosenthalbox</a> in the main area and 3 minis in the bedrooms.</p><h3>Joey Fox on Twitter: &quot;What do I do?#corsirosenthalbox !

A large one for the main floor and mini CR boxes for the bedrooms. Run them all on low.10/10 pic.twitter.com/ECBO4ykGHq</p><p>The CR box is right beside where we eat and where the kids play/watch TV. We turned it up to medium speed for meals. My wife either ate in a different room or waited until we left and ate by herself. We kept windows cracked intermittently.</p><p><strong>Humidifiers</strong> — we ran humidifiers in all the bedrooms every night. Tried to keep the home at 40% RH but because of the cold weather, it stayed around 30%.</p><p>With older kids, we could have had them stay in their rooms all day, but that wasn’t possible for us.</p><p>I moved into the guest room and kept the window cracked. I made sure a room was aired out (3 air changes) before removing my mask. If the kids wanted to play in the basement, I brought one of the mini CR boxes down.</p><p>We had a disadvantage — an unmasked, unvaccinated 3 yo. It’s been -10 deg C, couldn’t open windows for long or go outside. But we have a 4 bedroom single family home which helped.</p><p>There’s always an element of luck — how contagious someone is — but what we did worked.</p><ul><li>Vaccines work</li><li>Well fitting medical masks work</li><li>Filtration works</li><li>Humidifiers work</li></ul><p>My wife’s case was mild — she felt fluey and achy for a few days — that’s it. Many don’t have that.</p><p>I’ve seen horror stories about how contagious this can be — e.g. across hallways in hotels with brief exposure — but those aren’t the norm. Those stories do a disservice by making it seem impossible to stop this. It’s not.</p><p>Focus on clean air and proper masking (N95s). It can be stopped. Vaccines, humidifiers, filtration, open windows, go outside, respirators… <strong>Infection isn’t inevitable.</strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=56e1af5a8715" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://itsairborne.com/we-stopped-covid-in-our-home-56e1af5a8715">We stopped COVID in our home!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://itsairborne.com">It’s Airborne</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In-Room mitigation works for all types of spread (including close-range).</p><h3>Prof. Jose-Luis Jimenez on Twitter: &quot;I don&#39;t think this is consistent with updated scientific understanding.

See:https://t.co/AkCxOtrWbX</p><p><strong>All the In-Room mitigation methods are additive.</strong> They individually work to clean the air. Out-Of-Room methods clean the recirculated air. They aren’t as effective:</p><ol><li>All methods clean the same air. Once it’s clean, more mitigation doesn’t help. Diminishing returns.</li><li>If you are supplying air from one zone to another through a HVAC unit, that is long range transmission and lower risk (but still possible).</li><li>If the HVAC unit supplies many zones, then the recirculated air is diluted with air from all the zones. Virus concentrations supplied to the spaces will be low.</li><li>There are cases where out-of-room mitigation is completely useless, like HVAC units without recirculated air.</li><li>Is it possible that heating/cooling coils or going through the unit can damage the virus anyways? If the HVAC unit supplies a single space, then improvements are similar to in-room mitigation. The larger the HVAC unit is and the more zones it supplies, improvements only protect against long range transmission.</li></ol><p><strong>Out-Of-Room mitigation shouldn’t be completely dismissed.</strong> There are other health benefits. Bringing in more outdoor air lowers CO2 levels and improves cognition and health. MERV-13 filters remove all PM2.5 which is associated with adverse health effects.</p><p>Long range transmission still happens and mitigation is worthwhile, but shared room transmission is higher risk and should have higher focus. For smaller HVAC units, it’s still worthwhile to use the out-of-room methods.</p><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://www.itsairborne.com/tweets/engineering-methods/in-room-out-of-room/index.html"><em>https://www.itsairborne.com</em></a><em> on March 20, 2022.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=686b7e83a0eb" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://itsairborne.com/in-room-vs-out-of-room-airborne-mitigation-686b7e83a0eb">In-Room vs Out-Of-Room Airborne Mitigation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://itsairborne.com">It’s Airborne</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
